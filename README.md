### 📂 Featured Projects

#### 1. [Project Name: e.g., Dynamic Pricing Engine] (Regression Analysis)
> *Predicting optimal price points to maximize revenue based on historical sales data.*

* **The Business Problem:** The client faced revenue stagnation due to static pricing models that failed to account for seasonality and demand surges.
* **The Solution:** Developed a **Multi-Linear Regression model** utilizing 5+ years of transactional data. Engineered features including holiday indicators, competitor pricing, and inventory levels.
* **Key Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.
* **Impact:** Improved forecast accuracy by 18% and identified a 7% potential revenue uplift.

#### 2. [Project Name: e.g., Customer Churn Sentinel] (Classification)
> *Identifying at-risk high-value customers using ensemble learning techniques.*

* **The Business Problem:** High churn rates in the subscription segment were eroding monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
* **The Solution:** Built a robust **Classification Pipeline (Random Forest & XGBoost)**. The model analyzes user engagement logs and support ticket sentiment to flag high-risk accounts.
* **Key Tech:** Python, Imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, SHAP (for interpretability).
* **Impact:** Achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and enabled the retention team to proactively save 15% of at-risk accounts in Q1.

#### 3. [Project Name: e.g., Scalable ETL for ML Pipelines] (Data Engineering)
> *Architecting a resilient data pipeline to feed real-time ML models.*

* **The Scope:** Designed the end-to-end architecture to move data from raw logs to a structured data warehouse, optimized for AI consumption.
* **Result:** Reduced data latency by 40%, ensuring "AI-Ready" data availability for downstream GenAI applications.

### 🧠 My Solution Philosophy

My work is not just about writing code; it is about building **Intelligent Data Systems**.

1.  **User-Centric Design:** I treat dashboards and data products as software, conducting user research to ensure high adoption.
2.  **Scalability First:** I build architectures that adapt to evolving business requirements, avoiding technical debt.
3.  **From Descriptive to Prescriptive:** I help stakeholders move beyond "What happened?" to "What should we do?"
