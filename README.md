## 📂 Featured Portfolio Projects

### 1. ARR Revenue Forecast Engine (Regression) 📉
**Context:** Strategic Planning for High-Growth SaaS (MongoDB)
**Objective:** To replace manual, error-prone forecasting with an automated Machine Learning solution for Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).

* **The Challenge:** Leadership lacked predictive visibility into FY25-26 revenue streams, relying on static historical data.
* **The Solution:** Developed a robust **Regression framework** using Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas). The model correlates marketing KPIs with sales outcome data to predict future revenue.
* **Architecture:**
    * **Data Engineering:** Automated ETL from Salesforce/Internal DBs.
    * **Modeling:** Time-series forecasting combined with regressive feature analysis.
* **Business Impact:**
    * 🏆 **Awarded Marketing Operation Excellence Award** for successful implementation.
    * Provided critical predictive insights used for FY25-26 strategic planning.



### 2. Customer Conversion & Attribution Modeling (Classification) 🎯
**Context:** Marketing Lifecycle Optimization
**Objective:** To classify high-intent users and quantify marketing impact across the customer journey.

* **The Challenge:** Determining which marketing channels were actually driving conversions versus just generating noise.
* **The Solution:** A **Multi-Channel Attribution & Classification System**.
    * **Linear Attribution Model:** Quantified impact across touchpoints.
    * **Conversion Lift Studies:** Used statistical methods to classify and predict incremental performance of campaigns.
* **Technique:** Implemented Media Mix Modeling (MMM) and ROI analysis using Python libraries to classify campaign effectiveness.
* **Business Impact:**
    * **40% Increase** in engagement and data accuracy.
    * Optimized marketing spend across Google Analytics, Amplitude, and Segment.



### 3. Global Analytics Warehouse & ETL Automation ⚙️
**Context:** Enterprise Data Architecture (Deloitte USI)
**Objective:** Streamlining global reporting and enforcing data governance.
